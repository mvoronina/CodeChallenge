The projects that I was working on previously were school projects. I asked my instructor and just got a reply that I am not allowed to post my school projects as public because of Academic Misconduct. If I would have a chance to show them to you I would do that. 
I have a blog that I am working on now and the link is below:

Right now I am doing an online Angular course and it is going well. I really enjoy web development and would like to get more experience in this field, especcially working on real world projects with other actual developers.
